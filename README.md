### About:
After graduating from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, I am now ready to show all my projects! 

[**Phil's Portfolio**](https://philma.surge.sh)

I have built multiple apps, including: a game based on HTML/DOM manipulation, a React-based making API calls to show current NFL team rosters, and two full stack apps using React and Express/Node as well as React and Rails!
